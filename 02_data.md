# Data

For this analysis I will be using foursquare data to analyze different neighborhoods in three major German cities: Hamburg, Berlin and Munich.

One concern is that data for Germany may not be as extensive as it would be for the U.S. and the analysis may therefore not be as comprehensive.

I will be looking mainly at venue data which will enable me to identify find neighborhoods that share certain traits such as having many caf√©s or restaurants.
