Berlin, Hamburg and Munich are Germany's largest cities.
In this analysis I will explore how similar or dissimilar they are based on Foursquare location data.

My target audience are people moving from one city to another and wanting to know where they should rent their new apartment.

For example, if you move from Hamburg to Berlin which neighborhood should you move to based on your previous neighborhood?

Is Munich more similar to Berlin or to Hamburg?

What characteristics do the most popular neighborhoods have?
