## Discussion

The approach of going with algorithmically generated neighbourhoods has proved to lead to much better results than going with the official boroughs. Neighbourhoods in German cities appear to be defined by a very small radius and the boroughs therefore include many neighborhoods that can be very different from one another.

As expected the data in Germany is not as extensive as it is for American cities. I had to exclude several neighbourhoods because I could not even get 100 venue recommendations for them. This also means that all results shouls be taken "with a grain of salt".

## Conclusion

In this analysis I wanted to identify neighbourhoods in Berlin and Hamburg that are similar to one another so that I could use these as recommendations for people moving between the two cities.

I used a clustering algorithm and Foursquare venue recommendations to group 60 neighbourhoods.

Interestingly, I found that not a lot of neighbourhoods in each city share similar traits with neighbourhoods in the other city. Instead, only two clusters with 7 neighbourhoods each are represented in both cities.

Cluster 2 appears to be a cluster of neighbourhoods where many people live and therefore go out to Cafés and restaurants. Cluster 3 on the other hand is more targeted towards visitors (e.g. tourists or people travelling for work) with many hotels and theaters.

So if you're moving from Eimsbüttel to Berlin you may want to consider Schöneberg, Prenzlauer Berg or Friedrichshain for your next apartment.
