## Discussion

The approach of going with algorithmically generated neighborhoods has proved to lead to much better results than going with the official boroughs. Neighborhoods in German cities appear to be defined by a very small radius and the boroughs therefore include many neighborhoods that can be very different from one another.

As expected the data in Germany is not as extensive as it is for American cities. I had to exclude several neighborhoods because I could not even get 100 venue recommendations for them. This also means that all results shouls be taken "with a grain of salt".

## Conclusion

In this analysis I wanted to identify neighborhoods in Berlin and Hamburg that are similar to one another so that I could use these as recommendations for people moving between the two cities.

I used a clustering algorithm and Foursquare venue recommendations to group 60 neighborhoods.

Interestingly, I found that not a lot of neighborhoods in each city share similar traits with neighborhoods in the other city. Instead, only two clusters with 7 neighborhoods each are represented in both cities.

Cluster 2 appears to be a cluster of neighborhoods where many people live and therefore go out to Cafés and restaurants. Cluster 3 on the other hand is more targeted towards visitors (e.g. tourists or people travelling for work) with many hotels and theaters.

So if you're moving from Eimsbüttel to Berlin you may want to consider Schöneberg, Prenzlauer Berg or Friedrichshain for your next apartment.
