## Introduction

Berlin and Hamburg are two of Germany's largest cities and each year many people move from one city to the other.

In this analysis I will explore how similar or dissimilar their neighborhoods are based on Foursquare location data.

My target audience are people moving from one city to another and wanting to know where they should rent their new apartment.

Specifically, if you move from Hamburg to Berlin which neighborhood should you move to based on your previous neighborhood? What characteristics do these neighborhoods have?

The analysis will show that for several neighborhoods we will not find a similar counterpart in the other city. Two clusters, however, have a distinct venue mix and are represented in both cities.
